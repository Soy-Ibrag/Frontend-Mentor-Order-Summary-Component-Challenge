# Order Summary Card

## 📄 Project Overview
This project is my solution to the [Frontend Mentor Order Summary Component Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj/hub). The goal of the challenge is to build an order summary component using just HTML and CSS, while making sure it looks great on different screen sizes.

The project helped me practice writing clean and semantic HTML, working with CSS to style a visually appealing layout, and ensuring it's responsive for mobile devices. It's a great example of a common UI component you'd see in a real-world e-commerce site, like when reviewing an order before making a purchase.

## 💡 Biggest Challenges
This project definitely came with its challenges, and here are the ones I found toughest:

- Making it responsive: Getting the component to look good on both small and large screens was harder than I expected. I had to spend a lot of time tweaking the layout to make sure it didn’t break on different devices.

- Nailing the sizes: I struggled with getting the dimensions just right. Things like padding, margins, and font sizes took a lot of trial and error to balance, so the design felt clean and consistent.

- Flexbox: Flexbox was both my best friend and my biggest headache. While it helped with aligning things, I had to experiment quite a bit to make it work how I wanted, especially with vertical and horizontal centering.

These challenges were frustrating at times, but they helped me learn a lot and improve my skills with responsive design and layout.
